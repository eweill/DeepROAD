The exponentiation means that one more unit of evidence increases the weight given to any hypothesis multiplicatively. And conversely, having one less unit of evidence means that a hypothesis gets a fraction of its earlier weight. No hypothesis ever has zero or negative weight. Softmax then normalizes these weights, so that they add up to one, forming a valid probability distribution. (To get more intuition about the softmax function, check out the [section](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html#softmax) on it in Michael Nielsen's book, complete with an interactive visualization.)\n",
